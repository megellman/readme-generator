## Description
    
This project is a note application. When a user opens the application, they are presented with a hoempage with a begin button. When they click the begin button, they are lead to a page with their previous notes on the left-hand side and an option to create new notes on the right-hand side. When a user enters in a title and text, then a save button appears in the upper-right corner. When the save button is clicked, the note is added to the other saved notes on the left-hand side. There is also a trash icon on the note that allows a user to delete a note as well.

This project was created using Node.js and deployed with Heroku.

I created this project to gain exerience with Express.js and Heroku. This project helped me to understand the relationship between the frontend and the backend and how those two communicate with each other.
